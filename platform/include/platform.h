 * from this function.  Callers will provide a reason for the halt, and a
 * suggested action for the platform to take, but it is the platform's
 * responsibility to determine the final action taken.  For example, in the case
 * of a failed ASSERT or a panic, OLDK will call platform halt and suggest a Halt
 * action, but a release build on a platform with no debug channel may choose to
 * reboot instead as there is no one to tell about the ASSERT, and no one
 * waiting to debug the device in its halted state.  If not overloaded by the
 * platform, the default behavior of platform halt will be to dprintf the
 * reason, and then halt execution by turning off interrupts and spinning
 * forever.
